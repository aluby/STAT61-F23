1. Suppose we observe $X_1, ..., X_n \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ and we wish to test the hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ against $H_1: p \ne p_0$. 
    (a) What is the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$? 
    (b) What is the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ under $H_0$? 
    (c) Show that the acceptance region (the set of test statistics where we fail to reject $H_0$) corresponds to a $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\hat{p}$. 
2. Let $Y_1, ..., Y_n \sim N(\mu, 1)$. (*Note:* since $\sigma$ is known, you should not need the t-distribution)
    (a) Derive the form of the GLRT for testing $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu \ne \mu_0$. 
    (b) Now, find the GLRT if $H_1: \mu = \mu_1$. How does the rejection region depend on $\mu_1$?
3. Let $X_1, ..., X_n \sim \text{Exp}(\theta)$. Suppose that we wish to test $H_0: \theta \ge \theta_0$ against $H_1: \theta < \theta_0$. Let $X = \sum X_i$ and let $\delta_c$ be the test that rejects $H_0$ if $X \ge c$. 
    (a) Find $\pi(\theta | \delta_c)$ and argue that it is a decreasing function of $\theta$. 
    (b) Find $c$ such that $\delta_c$ has size $\alpha_0$
    (c) Let $\theta_0 = 2, n=1,$ and $\alpha_0 = 0.1$. Find the precise form of $\delta_c$ and sketch its power function.
