Up until this point, our focus has been on *point estimation*: if we have a parameter, what's the single "best guess" for that parameter, and how do we evaluate how good of a guess it is? 

Consider two estimators A and B that both have large-sample normal sampling distributions. 

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2.5
tibble(
  t1 = seq(-2, 2, by = .01),
  A = dnorm(t1, sd = .5),
  B = dnorm(t1, sd = .2)
) %>%
  pivot_longer(A:B) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = t1, y = value, col = name)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    x = "x",
    y = expression(f[x](x)),
    col = "Estimator"
  )

```

# Confidence Intervals 

Since we know the *shape* and *parameters* of the *sampling distribution*, we know that: 

\vspace{2in}

By inverting the terms in the probability statement, this is equivalent to: 

\vspace{2in}

**Example:** Among a random sample of 100 recent college graduates, the average monthly student loan payment was \$287, with a standard deviation of \$56.33. Construct a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$, the average monthly student loan payment among the population. 

\vspace{3in}

**Caution:** What can we conclude? 

(a) 95% of recent college grads have monthly student loan payments in this range
(b) There is a .95 probability that $\bar{X}$ falls in this range
(c) 95% of samples with $n=100$ would fall in this range
(d) There is a .95 probability that $\mu$ falls within this range 
(e) 95% of samples with $n=100$ would give an interval that contains $\mu$ 

**Example:** Below are the CI's from 100 samples where each $X_i \sim N(300, 60)$. 

```{r}
set.seed(1950)
replicate(100, rnorm(100, 300, 60)) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  summarize_all(list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  separate(name, into = c("sample", "summary")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = summary, values_from = value) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = sample, 
             x = mean, 
             xmin = mean - 2*(sd/sqrt(100)), 
             xmax = mean + 2*(sd/sqrt(100)))) + 
  geom_linerange() +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(mean - 2*(sd/sqrt(100)) > 300 | mean + 2*(sd/sqrt(100)) < 300) +
  labs(
    x = "95% CI"
  ) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  xlim(c(250, 350))
```

**Example:** Find a 90% confidence interval for $\mu$. 

\vspace{4in}

**Example:** Suppose we want to precisely estimate $\mu$ such that our confidence interval is no wider than $15.

**Example:** For a Pew Research survey of a representative sample of $n=2500$ adults, $X=1300$ said that they played video games. Let $\theta$ be the true proportion of adults who play video games. Give (a) the *exact* sampling distribution of $X$, (b) the approximate sampling distributions for $X$ and $X/n$. Use your answer from (b) to set up 95% CI's for $X$ and $X/n$.

# Bayesian Intervals 

In the Bayesian estimation framework, uncertainty intervals are no longer based on long-term *coverage* but are instead based on *uncertainty in the posterior*. 

Recall from Notes03 that if $X_1, ..., X_n \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ and $p \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$, then $p | \sum X \sim \text{Beta}(\sum X_i + \alpha, n - \sum X_i + \beta)$.

**Example:** Using the Pew Research sample above, what is the resulting posterior distribution $p|\sum X_i$? Assume a uniform prior distribution: $p\sim Beta(1, 1)$. How could we construct a 95% posterior probability interval? 

\vspace{4in}

Recall from Notes03 that if $X_1, ..., X_n \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2)$ ($\sigma^2$ known) and $\theta \sim N(a, b^2)$, then $\theta | X \sim N(\frac{b^2 \sum X_i + \sigma^2a}{nb^2 + \sigma^2}, \frac{\sigma^2 b^2}{nb^2 + \sigma^2})$.

**Example:** From our student loan payment example, $\sum X_i = \$ 287, n = 100$ and we'll assume $\sigma^2 = 60^2 = 3600$. Let's also assume a "flat" prior: $\theta \sim N(250, 100^2)$. What's the resulting posterior distribution? What's a 95% posterior probability interval?
