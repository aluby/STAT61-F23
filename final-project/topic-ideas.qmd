*Note:* I will continue to update this list as we go. If more than 3 groups propose the same project, I will ask you to coordinate to make sure your projects are different enough from one another. 

# Potential Topics 

1. Proof of Invariance of MLE
2. Expectation-Maximization (E-M) algorithm 
3. Gibb's Sampling
4. Jeffrey's Prior 
5. Prove Cramer-Rao 
6. Zero-Inflated Poisson Distribution
7. Cauchy distribution 
8. Conjugate Priors for Exponential Family
9. Confidence intervals for QQplots
10. Bayesian Estimation for $L_1$ loss function
11. Bayesian Highest Posterior Density Intervals 

You are also welcome to propose your own topic! I encourage you to talk with me before submitting a proposal to make sure that it is appropriate for the class.
